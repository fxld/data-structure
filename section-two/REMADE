The properties of the binary search tree are as follows:
1. All non-leaf nodes have at most two sons (Left and Right);
2. All nodes store a keyword;
3. The left pointer of a non-leaf node points to a subtree smaller than its keyword, 
and the right pointer points to a subtree larger than its keyword.
Establishing Binary Search Tree Recursive and Non-Recursive
Delete nodes recursively and non-recursively
If a binary search tree is built by binary recursion, it is probably AVL tree, but if it is built by inset, 
it is an unbalanced binary search tree
If you need to delete and add nodes, then after the operation, 
you need a binary tree or satisfy the nature of a binary search tree.
