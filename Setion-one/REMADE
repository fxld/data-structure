Minheap is a data-structure what is a complete two binary tree.
So it has all the properties of a complete binary tree.
Just like the tree node of son is easy to search from (N+1)/2.
If we know the property,we can easy to complete the Minheap in array.
About the Haffam,we just take out the RootNode where in the Minheap and complete the Haffam tree.
